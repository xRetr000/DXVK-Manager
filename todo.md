## Phase 1: Plan and design the application architecture
- [ ] Define overall application structure (modules, classes).
- [ ] Outline the responsibilities of each module.
- [ ] Decide on the GUI framework (Tkinter).
- [ ] Plan the UI layout and components.

## Phase 2: Implement core utility modules
- [x] Implement `exe_analyzer.py` for PE header analysis and DirectX detection.
- [x] Implement `github_downloader.py` for downloading DXVK releases.
- [x] Implement `file_manager.py` for file operations (copy, backup, symlink).
- [x] Implement `logger.py` for logging activities to `dxvk_manager_log.json`.

## Phase 3: Create the main GUI application
- [x] Set up the main window and basic layout in `gui.py`.
- [x] Add UI elements: buttons, labels, text area, checkboxes, dropdowns.
- [x] Connect UI events to `dxvk_manager.py` functions.
- [x] Display status and log messages in the GUI.

## Phase 4: Test the application and create documentation
- [x] Write unit tests for core utility modules.
- [x] Perform integration testing of the full application.
- [x] Create a `README.md` with usage instructions and troubleshooting.

## Phase 5: Package and deliver the final application
- [x] Prepare the application for distribution (e.g., PyInstaller).
- [x] Provide the final executable and source code.
